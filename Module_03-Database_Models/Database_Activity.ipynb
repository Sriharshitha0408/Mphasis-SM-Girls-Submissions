This is the most common and efficient way to create an auto-incrementing key in SQLite. When you insert a new row and don't provide a value for this column, SQLite automatically assigns the next available rowid.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Other Primary Keys:** If you define any other data type (like `TEXT` or `REAL`) or a composite key as the `PRIMARY KEY`, SQLite creates a regular index on that column. The hidden **rowid** still exists and is used internally, but your chosen primary key is the official identifier for the table.\n",

        "This is different from the default behavior of an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` alone. Without `AUTOINCREMENT`, if you were to delete the highest-numbered row, the next inserted row might reuse that now-available rowid. With `AUTOINCREMENT`, this never happens; the counter just keeps going up.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that `AUTOINCREMENT` is generally **not necessary** for most applications. The default behavior of a simple `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` is usually sufficient and more efficient. The `AUTOINCREMENT` keyword should only be used if you have a specific requirement to ensure that IDs are never reused and always increase, even after deletions."
